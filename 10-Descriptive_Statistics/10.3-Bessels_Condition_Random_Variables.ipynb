    "## Why Sample Variance is Divided by (n â€“ 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Concept Overview**\n",
    "When we calculate variance for a **sample** (not the full population), we divide by  \n",
    "$(n - 1)$ instead of $n$ to make the estimate of population variance **unbiased**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This adjustment is known as **Besselâ€™s Correction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Detailed Explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a **population variance**, we know the **true mean (Î¼)** of the entire population.  \n",
    "  So, we use the formula:  \n",
    "  $\\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum (x_i - \\mu)^2}{N}$  \n",
    "\n",
    "- In a **sample variance**, we only have a **sample mean ($\\bar{x}$)**, which is an **estimate** of the true mean.  \n",
    "  Because $\\bar{x}$ comes from the same sample, the deviations $(x_i - \\bar{x})$ are on average **smaller** than the true deviations $(x_i - \\mu)$.  \n",
    "  This makes the variance **underestimated** if we divide by $n$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To correct this bias, we divide by $(n - 1)$ instead of $n$.  \n",
    "This slightly increases the variance, giving a more **accurate estimate** of the population variance.\n",

    "### **Intuitive Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we take a small sample of 3 values:  \n",
    "$\\{4,\\ 7,\\ 9\\}$  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean ($\\bar{x}$) = $\\frac{4 + 7 + 9}{3} = 6.67$  \n",
    "2. Deviations from mean = (-2.67, 0.33, 2.33)  \n",
    "3. Squared deviations = (7.11, 0.11, 5.43)  \n",
    "4. Sum = 12.65  \n",

    "- If divided by $n$:  \n",

    "- If divided by $(n - 1)$:  \n",
    "  $\\frac{12.65}{2} = 6.33$  \n",
