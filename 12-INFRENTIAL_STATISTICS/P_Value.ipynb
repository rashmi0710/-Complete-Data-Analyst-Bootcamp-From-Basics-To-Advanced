    "### What is a P-Value?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **P-value (probability value)** is the probability of obtaining results **at least as extreme as the observed results**, assuming that the **null hypothesis (H₀)** is true.\n",

    "\n",
    "- A **small P-value** (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates **strong evidence against H₀**, so you **reject the null hypothesis**.  \n",
    "- A **large P-value** (> 0.05) indicates **weak evidence against H₀**, so you **fail to reject H₀**.\n",
